# ImageApp

This is an image manipulation program that lets you apply different effects to images. You can recolor images, make them negative or grayscale, rotate them using matrix multiplication, and overlay smaller images on top of bigger ones.

## How to run

```bash
java ImageAppGUI
```

The GUI lets you pick images from dropdown menus and apply different transformations like rotating and color effects.
